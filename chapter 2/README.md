# 🐍 Python Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository!

As a C++ developer, I'm starting from scratch with Python — exploring the language, understanding its syntax, and adapting to its dynamic and expressive style. This repo will serve as a personal log of all my practice, notes, and small projects as I grow more comfortable with Python.

## 🧠 Why I'm Learning Python

- To expand beyond C++ and dive into Python's simplicity and flexibility  
- To build automation scripts and backend systems  
- To explore future paths like Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI.
